== Continuous Deployment

Git branches named `release` or `release-` followed by anything (e.g. `release-2016LS`) are automatically deployed to {site-url} using Travis CI.

* Branch named `release` is deployed into the root of {site-url}.
* Branch named e.g. `release-foo` is deployed into {site-url}/foo/.

Please note that the name of a `release-` prefixed branch should not be the same as the name of any top-level directory in the `release` branch!
